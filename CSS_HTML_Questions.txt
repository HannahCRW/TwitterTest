CSS/HTML Questions
- Twitter uses ol/li to display tweets?
- Twitter displays profile picture in left margin?
- How to display account name, twitter handle, & time on one line but make them different classes?
		^^^ I think this should be easily done by just doing "display: inline"...no?
		^^^ Another way would be: instead of using a <div> you could use a <span> tag. It works exactly like divs (so you could give it a class or id), but it always has the inline property! 
- Need to change font color for twitter feed but nowhere else
		^^^ this should be easy enough, just with CSS?  just "color: #whatever" in the class specification.
